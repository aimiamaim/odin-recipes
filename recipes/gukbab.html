      <ol>
        <li>Add the pork bones and pork belly/butt to a large stock pot and cover with water.</li>
        <li>Place over high heat and bring to a boil, then lower heat to a rolling simmer for 25 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain bones into colander and toss all the liquid.</li>
        <li>Wash out the stock pot and rinse the bones and meat so no scum remains.</li>
        <li>Add the bones then the meat back to the now clean pot and cover with water (about an extra inch) again.</li>
        <li>Bring to a just boil, then lower to a simmer for 45 mins to an 1 hour.
        <li>When the meat is tender but not falling apart, remove the pork belly/butt and any bones with meat on them.</li>
        <li>Add them to a large bowl of ice water, to lower temperature and prevent discoloration.</li>
        <li>When cool enough to handle, remove the meat from the bones, and the belly/butt, pat the meat dry and store in the fridge until the soup is ready.</li>
        <li>Drain out half of the stock in the pot.</li>
        <li>Add the removed bones back to the pot and again add enough water to cover.</li>
        <li>Bring to just a boil, then to a low simmer for 8-12 hrs.</li>
        <li>Once your stock has simmered for at least 8 hrs, remove meat from the fridge and slice into thin slabs.</li>
        <li>Allow the meat to come to room temperature.</li>
        <li>Bring the broth to a boil.</li>
        <li>The broth should be free of any debris. Strain through a mesh sieve or cheesecloth to have a clear broth and set aside.</li>
        <li>Rinse the pot once again, add clear broth back to the pot and then return to a boil.</li>
        <li>Add 1 cup of rice into each serving bowl, cover with boiling broth and season with garnishes to taste.</li>
